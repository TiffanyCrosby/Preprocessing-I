          asked, on most. I am smart and learn quickly. My skills in HTML, CSS
          and Responsive Design improve everyday! <br />

            This project was a study on <strong>HTML</strong> and
            <strong> CSS</strong>. It was a great learning curve for me because
            I have no background in development. I was able to add some
            animations to the pseudo selector 'hover', as well as, create a
            contact page with a form.

            The goal of this project was to be able to
            <strong> a responsive design</strong> so that it could be viewed and
            used across many different screen sizes. It was very interesting to
            learn that you are not only adding formatting but also taking it out
            as well. <br />
            There is also a Services page linked in the navigation bar.

            This project was an extra project for me to work on
            <strong>practicing my HTML, CSS and Responsive Design skills</strong
            >. However, my main goal was to get media queries correct. I wanted
            to make sure that I was honing my skills and getting enough practice
            to remember what I am learning.
